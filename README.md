# Eye-Tracking-With-Lists
Code written to provide an answer and a new question on codereview.stackexchange.com

After providing a code review on codereview.stackexchange.com for this question
https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/146870/a-eye-analysing-eye-tracking-data
I remained interested and decided to implement the solution myself.

The solution was implemented on Mac OSX El Capitan using Xcode 8.2.3. It will port to
Linux or Windows but no makefile is provided for those systems.
